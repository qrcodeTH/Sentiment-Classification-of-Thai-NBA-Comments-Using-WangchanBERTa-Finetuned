## Sentiment Classification of Thai NBA Comments Using WangchanBERTa-Finetuned

# Introduction
This project focuses on sentiment classification of Thai NBA comments using transformer models. We utilize WangchanBERTa, a BERT-based model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis, to classify comments into three categories: Positive (POS), Neutral (Neu), and Negative (Neg).

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 500 Thai comments about the NBA from a Facebook fanpage. The data is stored in an Excel file with the following columns:
• text: The comment text.
• label: The sentiment label, which can be 'POS', 'Neu', or 'Neg'.

# Results
Accuracy: 72.00 %
Precision: 76.00 %
Recall: 72.00 %
F1 Score: 72.75 %
